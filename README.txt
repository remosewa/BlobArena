This allows you to compete with the specified blob engine. The location of the engine is hardcoded into EngineDriver line 45. You'll have to recompile to get it to run. 

Engines can be choosen between Ruby,Java,Javascript, or a Human can play player 2. But again, these are hardcoded. I never got around to fixing that.

Engines are located in the engine folder.
